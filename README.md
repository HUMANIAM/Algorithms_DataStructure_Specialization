# Algorithms_DataStructure_Specialization
this is repo about my solutions of problems in Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization in coursera site from algorithmic toolbox to Genome Assembly Programming Challenge

## Motivations to study it?

there are many reasons push me to spend good time with algorithms and their implementations
- I love programming but programming languages themselves are just tools to implement ideas (algorithms)
	so I decide to learn more about the ideas themselves.

- I want to be an efficient and excellent programmer. so I searched on google and found that enough 		understandin of algorithms and data structure will make you an efficient programmer

- I love problem solving so I began solve problems on [codeforces](http://codeforces.com) but there are 	very hard problems that I could not solve them. After that I know that study algorithms will enable 	you to solve them

- algorithms are everywhere in digital tech. It is important to know albeit little about them
- high companies request graduates who are good in algorithms.

## Courses and Their content

- [algorithms toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)
	- Week 1 : * stress testing : test your efficient algorithm vs your naive algorithms by generating 								  rondom test cases. starting with small output and edge cases

			   * complexity notations : bigO() : upper limit of your algorithm
			   							Theta() : lower limit of your algorithm
			   							omega() : if algorithm upper limit equal lower limit


	- Week 2 : * Fibonancci Numbers and other maths Functions like gcd(), lcm()
